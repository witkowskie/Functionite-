			    			<q>Every human life has many aspects</q>, said the <cite>professor</cite>. <q>The past of each one of us can be just as easily arranged into the biography of a beloved statesman as into that of a criminal. Only look
							thoroughly at yourself. Nobody is denying that yoti like your work. But what if it served you above
							all as an opportunity for escape? You weren't often seen at meetings, and when you did come,
							for the most part, you were silent. Nobody really knew what you thought. I myself remember that
							several times when a serious matter was being discussed you suddenly made a joke, which
							caused quess what. This was of course immediately forgotten, but now,
							when it is retrieved from the past, it acquires a particular significance. Or remember how various
							women came looking for you at the university and how you refused to see them. Or else your
							most recent essay, which anyone who wishes can allege was written from suspicious premises.
							All these, of course, are isolated facts; but just look at them in the light of your present offense,
							and they suddenly unite into a totality of significant testimony about your character and attitude.</q>
